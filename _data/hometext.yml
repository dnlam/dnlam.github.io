    Since 2025, I have held the position of Senior Research Specialist at <i>Nokia Standards (France)</i>. My research focuses on  <b>Generative AI</b> and Simulation Assistant for 3GPP standardisation.
    Prior to my arrival at Nokia, I carried out my research at <i> Orange Garden (France)</i>. The main goal is to leverage the advances of <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b> to automate network management and configuration.
    In 2022, I joined <i> Huawei Technologies France</i> as a researcher in <b> Traffic Engineering and Optimization</b> team. 
    My Ph.D. thesis is performed under supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bWndGhQAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1"><b>Dr. Emilio Calvanese Strinati</b> </a> 
    and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=U1OzIisAAAAJ&hl=en"> <b>Mr. Mickael Mam√§n </b> </a> at <i> CEA-Grenoble (France)</i>, 
    in which I jointly applied <b> AI/ML methods </b> and <b> advanced communication protocols </b> 
    for <b>5G Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications  (URLLC) </b>. <br>
    In my spare time, I am an avid sports enthusiast, with a particular interest in table tennis, skiing and football.
