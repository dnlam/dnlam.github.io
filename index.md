<p align="justify">
My name is Ngoc-Lam DINH (Lam DINH). Currently, I am a Ph.D candidate at the Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique (CEA) and Université Grenoble Alpes in Grenoble (UGA), France. Under supervision of <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/emilio-calvanese-strinati-6g"><b> Prof. Emilio Calvanese Strinati</b> </a> and <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/mickael-maman-6b1a3a82"> <b> Mr. Mickael Mamän </b> </a>, my research topic jointly applies <b> Learning methods </b> and <b> Advanced communication protocols </b> for Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications <b> (URLLC) </b> in 5G systems and beyond.<br> <br>

Before that, I graduated from Ha Noi University of Science and Technology  (Vietnam) in 2016 with a degree in <b> Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering </b>. My training mainly focused on several areas:  (1) Digital signal processing, (2) Wireless communication and (3) Embedded programming. Then, I took part in an <a href="http://www.upv.es/titulaciones/MUTSRC/indexi.html"> <b> international academic exchange program </b> </a> at Universidad Politecnica de Valencia (Spain) in 2017, with the courses given in <b> Signal theory, Wireless transmissions and Optical networks. </b> <br>  <br>

<a href="http://monabiphot.ens-paris-saclay.fr/"><b> My Master's degree </b> </a> is jointly awarded by the École Normale Supérieure Paris Saclay (France) and the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) in 2019. The courses focused on the applications of <b> Molecular photonics </b> for telecommunications and biosensors.<br> <br>

My research interests are <b> Digital signal processing</b>, <b> Learning approaches for wireless communication protocols (IoT, 5G and beyond)</b> and <b> Image processing with Deep Learning</b>. <br> <br>

In my free time, I am intesrested in playing football, hiking and visiting beautiful landscapes around Grenoble.<br>
