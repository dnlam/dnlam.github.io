<p align="justify">
My name is Ngoc-Lam DINH (Lam DINH). Currently, I am a Ph.D candidate at the Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique (CEA) and Université Grenoble Alpes in Grenoble (UGA), France. Under supervision of <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/emilio-calvanese-strinati-6g"><b> Prof. Emilio Calvanese Strinati</b> </a> and <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/mickael-maman-6b1a3a82"> <b> Mr. Mickael Mamän </b> </a>, my research topic jointly applies <b> learning methods and advanced communication protocols </b> for ultra-reliable and low-latency communications <b> (URLLC) </b> in 5G systems and beyond.<br> <br>

Before that, I graduated from Ha Noi University of Science and Technology  (Vietnam) in 2016 with a degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering. My training mainly focused on several areas: <b> (1) Digital Signal Processing, (2) Wireless Communication and (3) Embedded Programming </b>. Then, I took part in an <a href="http://www.upv.es/titulaciones/MUTSRC/indexi.html"> <b> international academic exchange program </b> </a> at Universidad Politecnica de Valencia (Spain) in 2017, with the courses given in <b> Signal Theory, Wireless Telecommunications and Optical Networks </b> <br>  <br>

<a href="http://monabiphot.ens-paris-saclay.fr/"><b> My Master's degree </b> </a> is jointly awarded by the École Normale Supérieure Paris Saclay (France) and the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) in 2019. The courses focused on the applications of <b> molecular photonics </b> for telecommunications and biosensors.<br> <br>

My research interests are <b> Digital Signal Processing, Learning approaches for Wireless Commmunication Protocols (IoT, 5G and beyond) and Image Processing with Deep Learning.</b> <br> <br>

In my free time, I am intesrested in playing football, hiking and visiting beautiful landscapes around Grenoble.<br>
