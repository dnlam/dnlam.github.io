# Hi there
My name is Ngoc-Lam DINH (Lam DINH). Currently, I am a Ph.D candidate at the Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique (CEA) and Université Grenoble Alpes in Grenoble, France. My research topic deals with ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) in 5G systems and beyond.

Before that, I graduated from Ha Noi University of Science and Technology  (Vietnam) in 2016 with a degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering. My training mainly focused on several areas: Digital Signal Processing, Wireless Communication and Embedded Programming. Then, I continued my study with a special interest in Signal Theory, Wireless Telecommunications and Optical Networks at Universidad Politecnica de Valencia (Spain) in 2017.   

My Master's degree is jointly awarded by the École Normale Supérieure Paris Saclay (France) and the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) in 2019. The courses are given with the focuses on the applications of molecular photonics for telecommunications and biosensors.

My research interests are Digital Signal Processing, Reinforcement Learning in Network protocol and Deep Learning.

In my free time, I am intesrested in playing football, hiking and visiting beautiful landscapes around Grenoble.
