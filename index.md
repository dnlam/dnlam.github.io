<p align="justify">
My name is Ngoc-Lam DINH (Lam DINH). Currently, I am a Ph.D candidate at the Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique (CEA) and Université Grenoble Alpes in Grenoble, France. Under supervision of <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/emilio-calvanese-strinati-6g">Prof. Emilio Calvanese Strinati</a> and <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/mickael-maman-6b1a3a82">Mr. Mickael Mamän</a>, my research topic jointly applies learning methods and advanced communication protocols for ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) in 5G systems and beyond.<br> <br>

Before that, I graduated from Ha Noi University of Science and Technology  (Vietnam) in 2016 with a degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering. My training mainly focused on several areas: (1) Digital Signal Processing, (2) Wireless Communication and (3) Embedded Programming. Then, I took part in an international academic exchange program at Universidad Politecnica de Valencia (Spain) in 2017, with the courses given in Signal Theory, Wireless Telecommunications and Optical Networks  <br>  <br>

My Master's degree is jointly awarded by the École Normale Supérieure Paris Saclay (France) and the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) in 2019. The courses focused on the applications of molecular photonics for telecommunications and biosensors.<br> <br>

My research interests are Digital Signal Processing, Reinforcement Learning in Network protocol and Image Processing with Deep Learning.<br> <br>

In my free time, I am intesrested in playing football, hiking and visiting beautiful landscapes around Grenoble.<br>
