<p align="justify">
Currently, I am holding a research engineer position in network optimazations at the <i> Huawei Paris Research Center (France)</i>. My main research focuses on safe data networks using <b>Learning-based models (DRL,LLMs, etc.)</b> and <b>Mathematical Optimization tools</b>. <br> <br>

In 2023, I obtained my Ph.D degree at the <i> Université Grenoble Alpes (CEA-LETI) </i> in France. My research topic is related to the applications of <b>Reinforcement Learning methods</b> and <b>wireless protocols</b> for Ultra-Reliable, Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) in 5G systems and beyond. <br> <br>
<!-- Under supervision of <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/emilio-calvanese-strinati-6g"><b> Prof. Emilio Calvanese Strinati</b> </a> and <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/mickael-maman-6b1a3a82"> <b> Mr. Mickael Mamän </b> </a>, my research topic jointly applies <b> Learning methods </b> and <b> Advanced communication protocols </b> for Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications <b> (URLLC) </b> in 5G systems and beyond.<br> <br> -->

<a href="http://monabiphot.ens-paris-saclay.fr/"><b> My Master's degree </b> </a> is jointly awarded by the <i> École Normale Supérieure Paris Saclay (France) </i> and the <i> Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) </i> in 2019. The courses offered interdisciplinary qualifications in the domain of <b> Molecular photonics </b> for telecommunications and biosensors.<br> <br>

In 2016, I graduated from the <i> Ha Noi University of Science and Technology </i> (Vietnam) with a degree in <b> Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering. </b> 
<!--My training mainly focused on several areas: <b> (1) Digital signal processing, (2) Mobile and wireless communications and (3) Embedded systems</b>.--> In the mean time, I took part in an <a href="http://www.upv.es/titulaciones/MUTSRC/indexi.html"> <i> international academic exchange program </i> </a> at the <i> Universidad Politecnica de Valencia (Spain) </i>, with the courses given in <b> Signal theory, Wireless transmissions and Optical networks. </b> <br>  <br>

My research interests are <b> Network Optimizations</b>, <b> Large Language Models (LLMs) for networking systems</b> and <b> Decision Making using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) </b>. <br> <br>
<!-- Advanced communication protocols (wireless and data networks) based on (safe) -->
In my spare time I am interested in table tennis, skiing and sightseeing.<br>
