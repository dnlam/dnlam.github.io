      <a class="label label-info"> Abstract <span class="abstract">Private networks will play a key role in 5G and beyond to enable smart factories with the required better deployment, operation and flexible usage of available resource and infrastructure. 5G private networks will offer a lean and agile solution to effectively deploy and operate services with stringent and heterogeneous constraints in terms of reliability, latency, re-configurability and re-deployment of resources as well as issues related to governance and ownership of 5G components, and elements. In this paper, we present a novel approach to operator models, specifically targeting 5G and beyond private networks. We apply the proposed operator models to different network architecture options and to a selection of relevant use cases offering mixed private–public network operator governance and ownership. Moreover, several key enabling technologies have been identified for 5G private networks. Before the deployment, stakeholders should consider spectrum allocation and on-site channel measurements in order to fully understand the propagation characteristic of a given environment and to set up end-to-end system parameters. During the deployment, a monitoring tools will support to validate the deployment and to make sure that the end-to-end system meet the target KPI. Finally, some optimization can be made individually for service placement, network slicing and orchestration or jointly at radio access, multi-access edge computing or core network level.

      <a class="label label-info"> Abstract <span class="abstract">This presentation describes recent activities on ultra-high speed Optical Wireless Communications (OWC) using Gallium-Nitride micro-LEDs designed and fabricated at CEA-Leti. Micro-LEDs are one of the most promising OWC optical sources due to their high illumination efficiency and their large modulation bandwidths. Preliminary work focused on the implementation of a 10-µm single blue micro-LED on sapphire wafer within an experimental OWC setup, mixing software generation of direct-current optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) patterns and hardware optical components for light collection, high speed photo-detection and digital acquisitions. Intensity modulation conveys DCO-OFDM waveform and direct detection is used at reception. A high current density of 25.5 kA/cm² provided a modulation bandwidth of 1.8 GHz. Associated to bit and power loading with up to a 256-QAM subcarrier modulation, it enabled a new data rate of 7.7 Gb/s, compared to the previous record of 5.37 Gb/s reached with a blue 21-µm microLED in 2016. Towards a better understanding of the micro-LED design impact on OWC performance, next investigations will study the electrical modelling of such micro-LEDs in the high frequency regime. Future works will cover the use of large arrays of more than 10 thousands micro-LEDs. The first objective is to open the way to new digital-to-optical modulations by independently driving each pixel, to remove digital-to-analogue converter and target highly integrated system-on-chips for ultra-high speed OWC transmitters. Secondly, higher emitted optical power is expected to open such technology to indoor multiple access applications where light collection and emitter-receiver alignment may not be possible anymore.
